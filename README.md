# This is your [AngularAttack](https://www.angularattack.com) 2016 Repo

This repo is the start of your AngularAttack 2016 entry. It contains the simple [Angular2 starter](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) files.

**DO NOT MAKE ANY CODE CHECKINS TO THIS REPOSITORY BEFORE THE COMPETITION OFFICIALLY BEGINS.**

**DOING SO COULD DISQUALIFY YOU.**


However, before the competition starts, there are some things we encourage you to do to get prepared for the competition.


## Step 1) Get Your Local Environment setup

Clone this repo locally, and make sure all your team members have access to it.

* Install the latest [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org).

* Run `npm install` in the project directory

* Run `npm start` to test that everything is running correctly locally


## Deploy Your App

While you can't make any checkins, what you **can** do is deploy this sample app to [Surge](https://surge.sh) (our competition hosting provider).

* `npm install -g surge`

* `surge .`
